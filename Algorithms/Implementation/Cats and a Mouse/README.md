### Task

Two cats named `A` and `B` are standing at integral points on the x-axis. Cat `A` is standing at point `x` and cat `B` is standing at point `y`. Both cats run at the same speed, and they want to catch a mouse named `C` that's hiding at integral point `z` on the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?

You are given `q` queries in the form of `x`, `y`, and `z`. For each query, print the appropriate answer on a new line:

- If cat `A` catches the mouse first, print `Cat A`.
- If cat `B` catches the mouse first, print `Cat B`.
- If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print `Mouse C` as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.

### Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, `q`, denoting the number of queries.
Each of the `q` subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of `x` (cat `A` 's location), `y` (cat `B` 's location), and `z` (mouse `C` 's location).

### Constraints

- 1 <= q <= 100
- 1 <= x,y,z <= 100

### Output Format

On a new line for each query, print `Cat A` if cat `A` catches the mouse first, `Cat B` if cat `B` catches the mouse first, or `Mouse C` if the mouse escapes.

### Sample Input 0

    3
    1 2 3
    1 3 2
    2 1 3

### Sample Output 0

    Cat B
    Mouse C
    Cat A

### Explanation 0

Query 0: The positions of the cats and mouse are shown below:

Cat `B` will catch the mouse first, so we print `Cat B` on a new line.

Query 1: In this query, cats `A` and `B` reach mouse `C` at the exact same time:

Because the mouse escapes, we print `Mouse C` on a new line.
